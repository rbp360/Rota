Years 7-13 are not covered by this app, but the teachers may have responsibilities for these year groups which will be marked on their individual sheets.

The teachers who are not form teachers (as above 4B, 2JM etc - so Billy and Jinny for example) should be considered before other teachers and what they are doing for specific periods should be shown within the availability checker (though the background should be 'amber rather than purple) to indicate that they are busy in that period (if indeed they are - if they are not bust then it can remaind as purple)
