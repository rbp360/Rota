There are quite a few issues though when working out cover. 

It has to be done period by period not day by day. 

Claire and Faye and I are the first port of call for cover they do not teach classes (but have meetings that do not appear on this document - their meetings will be included on future itterations). 

It may be best for this draft for the agent to aske "can Claire do it" Y/N "Can Faye do it" Y/N, then if not the following should apply:-

I look at people with lower teaching commitments like Ginny or Ben Sheild. 

Sunny tends to cover year 4 if Keith is off as she is a fully qualified teacher but she does have commitments in LEAP and Languages so sometimes cannot do full days with Year 4. 

I then look at people who have free periods. 

There is sometimes a requirement that people cover 1 or 2 times a week but this is very rare as Claire covers most of it with Faye.

Doing cover should be split fairly equally between all staff for fairness and to ensure that everyone takes turns.  

Keeping a log in the backend of who has done what cover will assist with this. 

There are tow classes per year group.  Some year groups with low numbers, I double up when people are absent. These are reception and year 3 so if one teacher is absent, they all go into their year group partners class for the day - ie both classes are combined. 

Finally, I also try to keep cover within key stages. I don't like asking year 1 teachers to cover year 6 for example. 

The Keystages are:- Early Years (sometimes referred to as EYFS) KS1 (key stage 1) and KS2 (key stage 2).  
EYFS = Reception
KS1 = years 1 and 2
KS2 = years 3,4,5,6
